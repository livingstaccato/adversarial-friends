# Changelog

## 0.1.0

First release. Dispatches a spec, plan, or review to other agent CLIs as
independent adversarial reviewers, then makes them argue about what they
found.

### Modes

- **`report`** — one round, every friend critiques in parallel, claims merge
  into one ranked report.
- **`crossexam`** — friends then judge the claims they did not write, blind,
  until each settles, deadlocks, or hits a ceiling.
- **`gate`** — every non-advisory claim that did not clear needs an explicit
  resolution. This is the mode that fails a build.
- **`loop`** — repeats until two consecutive rounds surface nothing new.

`afriend resolve` records a resolution and re-reports the gate. `afriend
init` writes a roster from what is installed. `afriend doctor` reports what
each friend can actually enforce, with `--json` and `--gc`.

### Friends

`claude`, `codex`, `agy`, `opencode`, and local models over `ollama`'s HTTP
API. Adapters declare what each CLI can enforce rather than assuming: schema
support, read-only mode, whether its effort level can be verified at all.

### What it refuses to fake

Most of the design work went into *not* claiming more than is true.

- **Blind presentation.** A judge is never told who wrote a claim — not the
  friend, and not the lens either, since round-robin assignment makes a lens
  identify its author just as surely.
- **Deadlocks are reported, never resolved.** Two judges who disagree leave
  the claim `deadlocked` with both sides quoted verbatim. Nothing here is
  entitled to break the tie by majority.
- **A judge that could not check the evidence settles nothing.** A verdict
  carrying `unverifiable` is downgraded before anything counts it, so no
  claim is ever dismissed on the strength of nobody having looked.
- **A resolution is an attestation.** The runner cannot know a defect is
  gone; it checks whether the location you named changed, and says which of
  three things it found. The one thing it refuses is `fixed` at an unchanged
  location.
- **Deduplication is judgment.** `--merge exact` under-merges on purpose;
  `--merge orchestrator` halts with exit 10 and asks.
- **No `--max-spend-usd`.** A dollar cap needs per-CLI cost reporting nobody
  has captured, and a flag that silently never fires is worse than none.
  `--max-calls` is derived from your roster and actually enforced.

### Containment

A CLI with no read-only mode of its own runs under `sandbox-exec` (macOS) or
`bwrap` (Linux), or it is refused. The macOS profile was built by
measurement, not documentation. What it removes is other repositories, SSH
and cloud keys, and the rest of your home directory; what it cannot remove is
network access and the friend's own credentials, which it needs to work at
all — stated plainly rather than implied away.

Rosters supply values only. There is no mechanism for a file to inject a
flag, and a repo-local roster is never loaded automatically: a cloned
repository does not get to choose who reviews it.

### Known gaps

- No adapter declares auth markers yet — none has been captured from a real
  auth failure, and guessing at stderr is what the design rejects. Repeat
  detection covers the cost of it meanwhile: a friend that fails identically
  twice stops being dispatched.
- A doc-scope friend of a read-only-capable CLI is not OS-confined. Closing
  it needs verified credential paths for those CLIs.
- `--merge orchestrator` is refused with `--mode loop`.

See `docs/superpowers/specs/` for the design and its recorded divergences.
