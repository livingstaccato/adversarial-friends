# Changelog

## 0.1.1

**Upgrade from 0.1.0 if you use `codex` or `agy`.** Both shipped schemas were
rejected by every schema-enforcing CLI, so cross-examination could not work
with either friend. Found by pointing the tool at its own source with a real
roster — the first thing it did was fail two of its three friends.

- **codex had never produced output under a schema.** OpenAI's strict
  structured-output mode requires `additionalProperties: false` on every
  object and `required` naming every property; neither schema had them, so
  the API rejected the request before the model saw the prompt.
- **agy failed every judging round.** The verdict schema's
  `evidence_assessment` enum contained `null`, which it rejects outright.
- The friend prompt contradicted the fixed schemas, telling friends to send
  one of `findings`/`no_findings` when strict mode requires both.

None of this was caught by 700 tests, because every test used the fake friend
(no schema) or ollama (`schema=False`).

### Confinement

Two holes straight through the middle of the sandbox, from the same review:

- **The environment was not filtered.** A confined friend inherited every
  secret exported in the runner's shell — 61 variables on the machine this
  was found on, four of them API tokens for unrelated services — readable
  without touching a single forbidden path. It now receives an allowlist,
  and the run records how many names were withheld (names only, never
  values).
- **Host-local networking is denied on macOS.** `127.0.0.1` was reachable, so
  a local database or another dev server was one request away.

Still open, and stated rather than implied: SBPL cannot filter numeric IPs, so
cloud metadata stays reachable on macOS; `bwrap` has no selective filtering at
all, so Linux keeps shared networking. Both need an egress proxy.

- The binary allowlist assumed a CLI's libraries sit beside its executable.
  They do not for any package-manager layout — `opencode` keeps a 61MB
  `node_modules/` beside `bin/`.

## 0.1.0

First release. Dispatches a spec, plan, or review to other agent CLIs as
independent adversarial reviewers, then makes them argue about what they
found.

### Modes

- **`report`** — one round, every friend critiques in parallel, claims merge
  into one ranked report.
- **`crossexam`** — friends then judge the claims they did not write, blind,
  until each settles, deadlocks, or hits a ceiling.
- **`gate`** — every non-advisory claim that did not clear needs an explicit
  resolution. This is the mode that fails a build.
- **`loop`** — repeats until two consecutive rounds surface nothing new.

`afriend resolve` records a resolution and re-reports the gate. `afriend
init` writes a roster from what is installed. `afriend doctor` reports what
each friend can actually enforce, with `--json` and `--gc`.

### Friends

`claude`, `codex`, `agy`, `opencode`, and local models over `ollama`'s HTTP
API. Adapters declare what each CLI can enforce rather than assuming: schema
support, read-only mode, whether its effort level can be verified at all.

### What it refuses to fake

Most of the design work went into *not* claiming more than is true.

- **Blind presentation.** A judge is never told who wrote a claim — not the
  friend, and not the lens either, since round-robin assignment makes a lens
  identify its author just as surely.
- **Deadlocks are reported, never resolved.** Two judges who disagree leave
  the claim `deadlocked` with both sides quoted verbatim. Nothing here is
  entitled to break the tie by majority.
- **A judge that could not check the evidence settles nothing.** A verdict
  carrying `unverifiable` is downgraded before anything counts it, so no
  claim is ever dismissed on the strength of nobody having looked.
- **A resolution is an attestation.** The runner cannot know a defect is
  gone; it checks whether the location you named changed, and says which of
  three things it found. The one thing it refuses is `fixed` at an unchanged
  location.
- **Deduplication is judgment.** `--merge exact` under-merges on purpose;
  `--merge orchestrator` halts with exit 10 and asks.
- **No `--max-spend-usd`.** A dollar cap needs per-CLI cost reporting nobody
  has captured, and a flag that silently never fires is worse than none.
  `--max-calls` is derived from your roster and actually enforced.

### Containment

A CLI with no read-only mode of its own runs under `sandbox-exec` (macOS) or
`bwrap` (Linux), or it is refused. The macOS profile was built by
measurement, not documentation. What it removes is other repositories, SSH
and cloud keys, and the rest of your home directory; what it cannot remove is
network access and the friend's own credentials, which it needs to work at
all — stated plainly rather than implied away.

Rosters supply values only. There is no mechanism for a file to inject a
flag, and a repo-local roster is never loaded automatically: a cloned
repository does not get to choose who reviews it.

### Known gaps

- No adapter declares auth markers yet — none has been captured from a real
  auth failure, and guessing at stderr is what the design rejects. Repeat
  detection covers the cost of it meanwhile: a friend that fails identically
  twice stops being dispatched.
- A doc-scope friend of a read-only-capable CLI is not OS-confined. Closing
  it needs verified credential paths for those CLIs.
- `--merge orchestrator` is refused with `--mode loop`.

See `docs/superpowers/specs/` for the design and its recorded divergences.
